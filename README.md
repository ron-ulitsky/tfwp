# Canadian Temporary Work Permits Data Visualization

This project provides a data pipeline and interactive web dashboard for exploring Canadian Temporary Work Permits, broken down by occupation and month.

This readme was entirely generated by an LLM so if anything doesn't make sense, just ask me.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning & Processing:**
  - Loads raw Excel data from IRCC.
  - Cleans and filters columns and rows to focus on occupation codes and monthly permit counts.
  - Outputs a processed Excel file for analysis.
- **Interactive Dashboard:**
  - Built with Streamlit (`app.py`).
  - Filter by occupation and month.
  - View raw and filtered data tables.
  - Visualize totals by occupation and month with bar charts.
