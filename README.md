# Canadian Temporary Work Permits Data Visualization


This project provides a data pipeline and interactive web dashboard for exploring Canadian Temporary Work Permits, broken down by occupation and month.

## Live Demo
You can view the dashboard online at: [https://tempfw.streamlit.app/](https://tempfw.streamlit.app/)

This readme was almost entirely generated by an LLM so if anything doesn't make sense, just ask me.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning & Processing:**
  - Loads raw Excel data from IRCC.
  - Cleans and filters columns and rows to focus on occupation codes and monthly permit counts.
  - Outputs a processed Excel file for analysis.
- **Interactive Dashboard:**
  - Built with Streamlit (`app.py`).
  - Filter by occupation and month.
  - View raw and filtered data tables.
  - Visualize totals by occupation and month with bar charts.
